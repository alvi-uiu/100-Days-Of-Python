This is because Python follows an **object-oriented programming (OOP)** model where every entity has attributes and methods.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Numbers are Objects**\nEven simple data types like integers and floats are objects in Python.\n\n```python\nx = 10  # x is an instance of the int class\nprint(type(x))  # Output: <class 'int'>\n\ny = 3.14  # y is an instance of the float class\nprint(type(y))  # Output: <class 'float'>\n```\n✔️ **Explanation**: `x` and `y` are objects of `int` and `float` classes, respectively.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Strings are Objects**\nStrings are instances of the `str` class.\n\n```python\ns = \"Hello\"\nprint(type(s))  # Output: <class 'str'>\n\nprint(s.upper())  # Output: HELLO (method of str class)\n```\n✔️ **Explanation**: `s` is an object of `str`, and it has methods like `.upper()`.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries are Objects**\nPython collections are also objects.\n\n```python\nlst = [1, 2, 3]\nprint(type(lst))  # Output: <class 'list'>\n\ntup = (1, 2, 3)\nprint(type(tup))  # Output: <class 'tuple'>\n\nd = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}\nprint(type(d))  # Output: <class 'dict'>\n```\n✔️ **Explanation**: `lst`, `tup`, and `d` are objects of their respective classes.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Functions are Objects**\nFunctions in Python are first-class objects, meaning they can be assigned to variables and passed as arguments.\n\n```python\ndef greet():\n    return \"Hello\"\n\nprint(type(greet))  # Output: <class 'function'>\n\nsay_hello = greet  # Assign function to a variable\nprint(say_hello())  # Output: Hello\n```\n✔️ **Explanation**: `greet` is an instance of `<class 'function'>` and can be assigned to another variable.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Classes and Instances are Objects**\nClasses themselves are objects, and instances of a class are objects too.\n\n```python\nclass Dog:\n    def __init__(self, name):\n        self.name = name\n\ndog1 = Dog(\"Buddy\")\nprint(type(Dog))  # Output: <class 'type'>\nprint(type(dog1))  # Output: <class '__main__.Dog'>\n```\n✔️ **Explanation**:  \n- `Dog` is an object of `<class 'type'>`.  \n- `dog1` is an object of the `Dog` class.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Takeaways**\n✅ Everything in Python (numbers, strings, functions, classes, etc.) is an **instance of some class**.  \n✅ Objects have **attributes (data)** and **methods (functions associated with them)**.  \n✅ Even functions and classes are **objects that can be assigned and manipulated**.","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-02-17T06:50:07.966778Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-02-17T06:50:07.967179Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-02-17T06:50:07.980270Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-02-17T06:50:07.967148Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-02-17T06:50:07.978633Z"}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null}]}
